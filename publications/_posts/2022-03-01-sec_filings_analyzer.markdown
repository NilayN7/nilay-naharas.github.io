This was a hig-prep problem in Inter IIT Tech Meet 10.0. We created a dashboard to measure growth and profitability for investors. I finetuned word embeddings that were generated using a pre-trained BERT model from Huggingface. I scraped SEC Filings from 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K forms for 292 companies using BeautifulSoup.

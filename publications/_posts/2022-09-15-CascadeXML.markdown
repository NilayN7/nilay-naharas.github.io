We propose a novel structure of a hardware security primitive namely the True Random Number Generator (TRNG) is proposed using Quantum Cellular Automata (QCA) technology. The AND gate, XOR gate and a gate with irregular behavior are used to generate random output depending upon the AQ1 metastability of the QCA structure. Furthermore, the structure is cross-looped and asymmetrically inverted to induce additive randomness.

The Existing literature does not focus on evaluating different aspects of Persona injection. We employ prompt tuning techniques, specifically in-context and chain-of-thought methods, to generate open-ended dialogues that closely align with the assigned personas. Then performance of our model is evaluated using a robust framework that includes metrics such as LLMEval (using 5 LLMs) for fluency and Coherency , MMLU score for reasoning ability. We also achieve better performance than human generated dialogues for Fluency and Coherency. Additionally, we evaluate the toxicity scores to ensure the generated responses are devoid of harmful content, bias, and dishonesty to further enhance the chatbot’s performance. The results demonstrate visible improvements in the chatbot’s ability to generate coherent, contextually relevant, and persona-aligned dialogues.

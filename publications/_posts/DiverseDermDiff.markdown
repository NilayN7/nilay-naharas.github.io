Limited representation of darker skin tones in current dermatology datasets and benchmarks hinder the performance of and ability to ethically and safely deploy Artificial Intelligence for dermatology in the clinical setting. We present DiverseDermDiff a image generation pipeline for diversity evaluation in dermatology datasets by reformulating it as a classification task. DiverseDermDiff combines InstructPix2Pix and LLaVa for image generation and prompt verfification, respectivelyy. Fine‑tuned ResNet‑18 classifier on the diverse set of images led to 21.21% accuracy gains. We evaluated the diversity in HAM10k and DDI datasets.

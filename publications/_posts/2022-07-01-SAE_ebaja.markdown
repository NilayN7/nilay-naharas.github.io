I participated in the SAE eBAJA nationwide design competition. Being the Co-Head of Powertrain Department, I designed and implemented the Electric Powertrain of the All-Terrain Vehicle (E-ATV).We used a 4kW 48V PMSM motor, 48V 150A PMSM controller and 110 Ah 48V Li-ion Battery. Also installed a motor controller to regulate the speed and torque of the motor, a DC to DC converter to power auxiliary units and integrated hall sensors. Our team secured **AIR 8** among 82 teams nationwide in eBAJA design competition.

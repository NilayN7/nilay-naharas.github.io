The Existing literature does not focus on evaluating different aspects of Persona injection. We employ prompt tuning techniques, specifically in-context and chain-of-thought methods, to generate open-ended dialogues that closely align with the assigned personas. Then performance of our model is evaluated using a robust framework that includes metrics such as LLMEval (using 5 LLMs) for fluency and Coherency , MMLU score for reasoning ability. We also achieve better performance than human generated dialogues for Fluency and Coherency. Additionally, we evaluate the toxicity scores to ensure the generated responses are devoid of harmful content, bias, and dishonesty to further enhance the chatbot’s performance. The results demonstrate visible improvements in the chatbot’s ability to generate coherent, contextually relevant, and personaaligned dialogues.

We evaluated the impact of diversity in dermatology datasets on AI diagnostic systems by training a classifier on a standard skin lesion dataset and testing it on a more diverse dataset with underrepresented skin tones. We prepare a bunch of prompts that contain image editing instructions. These prompts are then used to generate images using InstructPix2Pix with the given prompts. The accuracy of the edited images for each prompt is then measured using CIEDE2000 color metric to determine the best prompt. We then generate images of lesions for skin tones IV, V, and VI on the Fitzpatrick Phototype Scale. The generated images are then Fine-tuning the classifier on these synthetic images was expected to enhance its performance by exposing it to a broader range of skin lesion presentations.

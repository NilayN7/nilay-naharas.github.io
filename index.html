            I am a graduate student in <a href = "https://www.cs.ucla.edu/"> <u> Computer Science </u> </a> at the <a href = "https://www.ucla.edu/"> <u> University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) </u> </a>. I am passionate about bridging the gap between cutting-edge machine learning research and its practical application, ensuring that deployed solutions are not only reliable but also secure and impactful.

        <p>
            In August 2023, I graduated from the <a href = "https://www.iitjammu.ac.in/"> <u> Indian Institute of Technology Jammu (IIT Jammu) </u> </a> with a B.Tech. in Electrical Engineering with a minor in Computer Science and Engineering. I worked on "Low-light Action Recognition" for my B.Tech. thesis under the guidance of <a href = "https://sites.google.com/view/badrisubudhi/home"><u> Prof. Badri N. Subudhi </u> </a>. I had the privilege of working on the project "Adversarially Robust and Efficient Neural Networks" under the mentorship of <a href = "https://cfaed.tu-dresden.de/pd-staff-kumar> <u> Prof. Akash Kumar </u> </a> at <a href="https://tu-dresden.de/?set_language=en"> <u> TU Dresden </u> </a>, as well as the innovative "Drill Core Analysis" guided by <a href="https://rohitash-chandra.github.io/"> <u> Prof. Rohitash Chandra </u> </a> at the <a href="https://www.unsw.edu.au/"> <u> University of New South Wales Sydney (UNSW) </u> </a>. I spent the summer of 2022 at <a href = "https://www.worldquant.com/"> <u> WorldQuant </u> </a>as a Quantitative Research intern. My experience also includes an internship at <a href ="https://www.se.com/in/en/"> <u> Schneider Electric </u> </a>, where I focused on "Solder Joint Reliability Prediction for Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs)". Prior to these roles, I was an undergraduate researcher at <a href="https://www.ic-resq.com/"> <u> IC-ResQ Lab </u> </a> under the supervision of <a href="https://www.ic-resq.com/people/group-leader"> <u> Dr. Ambika Prasad Shah </u> </a>, where I worked on developing a True Random Number Generator (TRNG) utilizing Quantum Cellular Automata (QCA).

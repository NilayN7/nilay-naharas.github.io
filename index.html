            I am a graduate student in <a href = "https://www.cs.ucla.edu/"> Computer Science</a> at the <a href = "https://www.ucla.edu/"> University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA)</a>. I am passionate about bridging the gap between cutting-edge machine learning research and its practical application, ensuring that deployed solutions are not only reliable but also secure and impactful.

            In August 2023, I graduated from the <a href = "https://www.iitjammu.ac.in/"> Indian Institute of Technology Jammu (IIT Jammu)</a> with a B.Tech. in Electrical Engineering with a minor in Computer Science and Engineering. I worked on "Low-light Action Recognition" for my B.Tech. thesis under the guidance of <a href = "https://sites.google.com/view/badrisubudhi/home">Prof. Badri N. Subudhi </a>. I had the privilege of working on the project "Adversarially Robust and Efficient Neural Networks" under the mentorship of <a href = "https://cfaed.tu-dresden.de/pd-staff-kumar>Prof. Akash Kumar</a> at <a href="https://tu-dresden.de/?set_language=en"> TU Dresden</a>, as well as the innovative "Drill Core Analysis" guided by <a href="https://rohitash-chandra.github.io/">Prof. Rohitash Chandra </a> at the <a href="https://www.unsw.edu.au/">University of New South Wales Sydney (UNSW)</a>. I spent the summer of 2022 at <a href = "https://www.worldquant.com/"> WorldQuant </a>as a Quantitative Research intern. My experience also includes an internship at <a href ="https://www.se.com/in/en/">Schneider Electric</a>, where I focused on "Solder Joint Reliability Prediction for Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs)". Prior to these roles, I was an undergraduate researcher at <a href="https://www.ic-resq.com/">IC-ResQ Lab </a> under the supervision of <a href="https://www.ic-resq.com/people/group-leader">Dr. Ambika Prasad Shah</a>, where I worked on developing a True Random Number Generator (TRNG) utilizing Quantum Cellular Automata (QCA).

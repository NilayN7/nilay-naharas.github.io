I am a graduate student in [Computer Science](https://www.cs.ucla.edu/) at [UCLA](https://www.ucla.edu/). I am passionate about bridging the gap between cutting-edge machine learning research and its practical application, ensuring that deployed solutions are not only reliable but also secure and impactful.

In August 2023, I graduated from the [IIT Jammu](https://www.iitjammu.ac.in/) with a B.Tech. in Electrical Engineering with a minor in Computer Science and Engineering. I worked on "Low-light Action Recognition" for my B.Tech. thesis under the guidance of [Prof. Badri N. Subudhi](https://sites.google.com/view/badrisubudhi/home). I had the privilege of working on the project "Adversarially Robust and Efficient Neural Networks" under the mentorship of [Prof. Akash Kumar](https://cfaed.tu-dresden.de/pd-staff-kumar) at TU Dresden, as well as the innovative "Drill Core Analysis" guided by [Prof. Rohitash Chandra](https://rohitash-chandra.github.io/) at the University of New South Wales Sydney (UNSW). I spent the summer of 2022 at [WorldQuant](https://www.worldquant.com/) as a Quantitative Research intern. My experience also includes an internship at [Schneider Electric](https://www.se.com/in/en/), where I focused on "Solder Joint Reliability Prediction for Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs)". Prior to these roles, I was an undergraduate researcher at [IC-ResQ Lab](https://www.ic-resq.com/) under the supervision of [Dr. Ambika Prasad Shah](https://www.ic-resq.com/people/group-leader), where I worked on developing a True Random Number Generator (TRNG) utilizing Quantum Cellular Automata (QCA).
